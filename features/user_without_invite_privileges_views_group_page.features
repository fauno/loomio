Feature: User without invite privileges views a public group page
  As a user without invite privileges
  So that I am not compromising anyone's privacy
  I should not see the list of invited users' email addresses

Scenario: Logged out user views a public group page
  Given a public group exists
  When I visit the group page
  Then I should not see the list of invited users
